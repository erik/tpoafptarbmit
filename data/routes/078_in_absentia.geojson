There was talk about a replay of last year's ride to Christmas Tree Lane (#27), but now it sounds like he might do the epic Mosey route we covered (#69) or perhaps the crossword ride (#68). Alternatively, if the weather is uncooperative, there is always the chance of a trip to Shatto Lanes. Who knows? It is a world of uncertainty, friends, and -- Dylan notwithstanding -- you can't predict the way the wind will blow even if you've got a weatherman at your side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <br/>\n <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"http://www.thepassageride.com/Routes/77\">\n  Previous Route\n </a>\n |\n <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"http://www.thepassageride.com/Routes/79\">\n  Next Route\n </a>\n</p>\n",
